## Introduction
---
We used a dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#) to understand how Portugese students performed in two classes: Math and Portugese. In addition to students' grades, the data sets included social and familial attributes like time spent going out with friends and the quality of the relationship at home.
