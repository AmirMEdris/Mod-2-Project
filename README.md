## Introduction
---
We used a dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository (link: [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#)) to understand how Portugese students performed in two classes: Math and Portugese. In addition to students' grades, the data sets included social and familial attributes like time spent going out with friends and the quality of the relationship at home. There were a total of 32 original attributes that we worked with in addition to some features that we created. The data was, thankfully, very clean. 
Most visualizations were done using ``` seaborn ``` and ``` matplotlib ```. For statistical tests, we used ``` scipy.stats ``` and for regression we used ``` sklearn ```, ``` pandas ``` and ``` numpy ```.

## Our Question 
---
What gives a student the most chance of success in school? We started this project with a few assumptions about what *we* thought was the answer to that question and were suprised with our results. 

## Observations/Findings
---
Visuals and blurbs about findings 

## 'Conclusions' and Recommendations 
---
'Conclusions' in quotes because we should talk about how while we did get interesting results, we found that more and more this data was really meant for classification problems. We are excited to learn more about this in the upcoming modules in Flatiron School to bridge the connections that we are alluding to in this project.
